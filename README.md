# Python-Task  
This project has a series of asks testing basic knowlegde in verious Python topics. The Tasks are as follows:  
**1. Checking whether a string is a Palindrome in a Stack**  
A **_Stack_** is a data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out(LIFO) principle in managing the order of operations or data elements.  
A **_Palindrome_** is a sequence of characters, numbers, string or other data elements that read the same way forward and backword, ignoring spaces, punctuation and sometimes spacing.  
In this task, I first converted the string into lower case, then removed the spaces. Then, I created and empty stack where I would append the characters that would then be used to check if a string is a palindrome or not.  
**2. Concept of List Comprehension**  
I wrote code to generate sample lists for the following scenarios:  
-**_Simple List Comprehension_**   
-**_List Comprehension with a condition_**  
-**_List Comprehension wit a Transormation_**  
-**_Nested List Comprehension_**  
-**_List Comprehension with a Function_**   
-**_List Comprehension with Multiple Conditions_**
**3. Explaining Compound Datatypes**  
These are datatypes that can hold multiple elements, of different datatypes. These are:   
**_Lists_** - These are an ordered collections of data elements that can be changed after the list is created.  
**_Tuples_**- These are similar to liss, however, the elements cannot be changed after the tuple is created.  
**_Dictionaries_**- A Dictionary is an unordered collection of key value pairs. The keys should be unique, and will be used to access the corresponding values.
